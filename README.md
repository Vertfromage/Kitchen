# kitchen
A fun set of Java objects to make up a kitchen. 

This was my exercise for Tim Buchalka's course on Java the challenge on "composition".  
I got carried away with the sillyness of having methods for my objects in my kitchen.
Basically I had things like makeDinner and CleanUp complete with the snarky comments from mom.
